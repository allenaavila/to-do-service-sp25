# ✓ Effortless to-do list integration

| [**Get started**](../../docs/before-you-start-a-tutorial.md) | [**Tutorials**](../../docs/tutorials.md) | [**Search the docs**](../../docs/overviews/placeholder.md) |

Integrate task management into your apps with the to-do service. You can [**create**](../../docs/tutorials/add-a-new-task.md), [**prioritize**](../../docs/overviews/placeholder.md), and [**remind**](../../docs/overviews/placeholder.md) with just a few RESTful API calls. The service and your data is [**securely hosted**](../../docs/overviews/placeholder.md) in the to-do service private cloud.

*Example of JSON used to create a new user with the POST method and an endpoint of `{base_url}/tasks`*

```json
{
    "user_id": 23,
    "title": "Set up Zoom meeting with web team",
    "description": "Kick off new product release campaign",
    "due_date": "2025-05-19T14:00",
    "warning": "-10"
}
```
