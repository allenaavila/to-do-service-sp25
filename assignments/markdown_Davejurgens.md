# Advantages and Disadvantages of Markdown 

## Advantages

**Portability:** *Markdown* files are plain text, so they are smaller in size and easy to transfer across platforms and devices.  
**Readability:** Even the plain text version is perfectly readable in its unrendered form.<br> 
**Simplicity:** *Markdown* is easy to learn and use.

## Disadvantages

**Styling Limitations:** Markdown's syntax doesn't allow for direct control over fonts, colors, or layouts as HTML 
or CSS does.<br>
**Inconsistent Rendering:** Markdown lacks a single, universally accepted standard, leading to variations and inconsistencies in how different Markdown processors render the same content.<br>
**Unescaped HTML:** Markdown doesn't automatically escape HTML tags, which can be exploited by attackers.
